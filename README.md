##This is a super fast algorithm to calculate the combined length of every number in a range

This is to show that number algorithms must be design with care
If we do this we can have a tremendous speed up for every number crunching algorithm

I think this algorithm can be handy when looking up numbers in memory

I hope someone finds this usefull
